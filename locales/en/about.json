  "p1": "I was born in Salamanca, Spain, where I grew up and currently reside. I started in the world of photography, back in 2002, when I was still a teen. The first camera I had in my hands was an Olympus C-200.",
  "p2": "then I had my first DSLR camera, a famous Canon EOS 350D, with which I spent many years. Skateboarding and underground music like hardcore punk, have allowed me to grow as a creator and observe the world in another way.",
  "p3": "I had my first analog camera in 2013, a Canon EOS 50E, my first film, a Fujifilm C-200, and everything else is these stories.",
