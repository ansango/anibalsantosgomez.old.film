      I was born in Salamanca, Spain, where I grew up and currently reside. I
      started in the world of photography, back in 2002, when I was still a
      teen. The first camera I had in my hands was an Olympus C-200.


      Then I had my first DSLR camera, a famous Canon EOS 350D, with which I
      spent many years. Skateboarding and underground music like hardcore punk,
      have allowed me to grow as a creator and observe the world in another way.


      I had my first analog camera in 2013, a Canon EOS 50E, my first film, a
      Fujifilm C-200, and everything else is these stories.
